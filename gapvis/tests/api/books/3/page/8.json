{"text":" 20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V, cannot be exactly known in what determinate part, whe- ther in the beginning or middle, or any other portion, of a magistracy, any important event occurred. But, if the computation proceed by summers and winters, which method I have observed, such an inquirer will find, that these two halves being equivalent to a whole year, ten complete summers, and the same number of winters, elapsed in the course of this first part of the war. The Laced  monians, for to them it fell by lot to make the first restitutions, released immediately what prisoners they had in their hands; and, having dispatch- ed Ischagoras, and Menas, and Philocharidas, in the quality of their embassadors to the cities of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501638\" >Thrace<\/span>, or- dered Clearidas to deliver up <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span> to the Athe- nians, and all the consederates there to submit to the terms of the treaty, according to the stipulation given for them. But this they positively refused, as they judged the treaty prejudicial. Clearidas also, to ingra- tiate himself with the Chalcideans, would not deliver up <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>, alledging, that, without their concurrence, he could not possibly do ir. He himself returned in person soon after with the embassadors, in order to make his defence at Laced  mon, mould Ischagoras accuse him there of disobeying orders. His view was, farther, to try if the accommodation could by any means be eva- ded. But, when he found it fast confirmed, he posted back with all speed to his government, having expresi orders from the Laced  monians to deliver up Amphi- polis; or, if that was beyond his power, to cause all the Peloponnesians within that garrison instantly to evacuate the place. The confederates happened, at this juncture, to be at Laced  mon, where such of them, as had hitherto refused to accept the treaty, were ordered by the Lace- d  monians to accede to it. But this they positively re- fused, alledging the same reason as before; and plainly affirming, that\" they would not come in, till better\"terms than the present were obtained for them.\" Their","image":false}
