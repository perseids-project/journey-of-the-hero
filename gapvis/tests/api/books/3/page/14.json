{"text":" 26 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V. I infallibly come in. And, after suggesting such a course, the Corinthians also returned home. The persons at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, who had listened to these insi- nuations, reported the scheme, in the next place, to the whole magistracy and people of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>. The Argives resolved accordingly, and elected a committee of twelve, with whom such Grecians, as desired it, might agree upon an alliance, the Athenians and Laced  monians excepted.
