For the Laced  moni- ans, till the enemy flieth, maintain their combats with long and steady toil; but, after a rout, pursue them neither long nor far. And thus, or very nearly thus, was the procedure of the whole battle, the greatest that for many ages had been fought amongst Grecians, and where the competi- tion lay between most renowned and flourishing Stales. The Laced  monians, amassing together the arms of their enemies who had been stain, immediately erected a trophy, and rifled the bodies of the dead.
