The Laced  monians, in the same winter, joined by their allies, those of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span> excepted, and marching into Argia, ravaged a small part of that territory, and carried off the corn, having brought carriages for that purpose. They also removed the Argive exiles to Or- nea, and left them a small detachment from their main army for the security of their persons. A temporary truce being also made, during which the Orneat  and Argives were to abstain from all hostilities against one another, they drew off the army to their respective homes. However, not long after this, the Athenians arrived with thirty sail of ships and six hundred heavy-armed. The Argives, in conjunction with the Athenians, took the field with all their strength, and besieged those in Grnea for the space of a day. But, as at night the be- siegers removed to a distance in order for repose, those of Ornea made their escape.

Thus ended the winter, and with it the sixteenth year of the war, of which Thucydides hath compiled the history. YEAR","image":false}
