Here they obliged all the citizens to lodge what corn they already had, and all that should hereafter be imported, and here on- ly to expose it to sale and to vend it. These proceedings had for a long time drawn sharp1 insinuations from Theramehes; arid, when the embassy returned from Laced  mon without bringing to any mariner of issue a general accommodation for the wholei of the Std(et he averred, that** by this new work the** safety of the city toas visibly endangered.\" For from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, at this instant of time, at the rex. quest of the Eub  ans, no less than forty-two fail of (hips were on the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span>; some of which were Ita- lian, from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span> and from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"344424\" >Locri<\/span>, and some Sici- lian; and all were now bound sor Eub  a.
