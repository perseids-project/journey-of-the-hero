B.V1I. with the Laced  monians and Corinthians, they had ob- jected their own State to the fury of a storm which threatened them all, and, by their own personal valour in naval engagements, had contributed most to such a height of success. The various people, now got together at this one city of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>, were so very numerous, as to be exceeded only by the comprehensive roll of those who, in the se- ries of the present war, sided either with the States of A- thens or <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span>.

And all these hitherto recited were Ioi.ians and Athenian colonies, excepting the Carystians, for these last areDryopes; but, as sub- jected to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, not so much from choice as Ionians, as","image":false}
