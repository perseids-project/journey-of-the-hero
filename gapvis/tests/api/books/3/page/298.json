{"text":" 3io THE PELOPONNESUN WAR. B.VIIJ, did less damage than on the preceding day. After scouring and laying waste the terjispJiy of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>, they failed baek to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>. About the same time, Astyochus having rejoined the fleet at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, the Peloponnesians were still abound- ing in all the needful expedients of war. Good pay was regularly advanced them, and the soldiers had store of rnoney yet remaining of the rich booty they made at Iafus. The Milesians, farther, sustained. with alacrity the burden of the war. It was, however, the opinion of the Peloponnesians, that the first treaty made with Tissaphernes by Chalcideus was in some articles defective and less advantageous to themselves. Upon this they drew up and ratified a. second in the presence of Theramenes. The articles of it are these:*'. STIPULATED, by the Laced  monians and\"conftderates, with king Darius and the sons of the\"king and Tissaphernes, that peace and amity subsist*c on the following conditions:\"Whatever province or city soever belongeth to\"king Darius, or did belong to his father or ancestors,*' against them in a hostile manner not to march, and*? no injury to do, are bound both Laced  monians and,*' confederates of the Laced  monians. Not to; exact-.\"tribute from any, soch places, are bound both Lace-.\"d  monians and confederates of the Laced  monians.** Neither shall king Darius, nor any. subject of the-\"king, march in a hostile manner against, nor dp any.** injury to the Laced  monians and confederates.\"But, in cafe the Laced  monians or confederates.*' need any assistance whatever from the king; or the;*' king from the Laced  monians and confederates;*f whatever either party can convince the other to be-** right, let that be done.\"Be the war against the Athenians and confederates.*' carried on by both parties in strict conjunction.
