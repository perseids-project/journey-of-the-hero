Laced  monians to agree to these proposals; that,\"for\"the present, a peace mould be concluded for the termK of fifty years; provided, notwithstanding, that liber-\"ty remain to either party to send a challenge, when\"neither was embarrassed by plague or war, and the** right of this district be then decided by arms between*f Laced  mon and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, as had formerly been done*\"when the victory was equally claimed on both sides;*f and that, in this case, it be not lawful to carry the*f pursuit beyond the boundaries of either <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span> or <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  mon.\" These proposals, it is true, appeared at first to the Laced  monians to be foolish; but, ac length, as their necessary interest made them vastly desi- rous of the Argive friendship, they complied with the demand, and the terms agreed on were digested into writing. But the Laced  monians, before they put the last hand to the treaty, insisted on their previous return to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, and reporting it to the people; and, in cafe the ratification was given, to repair again to Laced - mon, at the Hyacinthian festival, and swear obser- vance. And upon this they returned to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>.* Herodotus relates this remarkable piece of history in Clio.\"They had a con- f* ference, (fays he,) and came to an agreement, that three hundred men on each\"fide should decide the point by combat, and the land contested should remain the'* property of the victors; that both armies in the mean time should retire within\"their respective dominions, nor be present at the combat, lest, by being spectators\"of it, either of them, seeing their countrymen defeated, might run to their assist-*' ance. When articles were settled both armies drew off: those selected on each\"fide for the combat staid behind aud engaged. They fought it out with equal reso-U lution and fortune: Of fix hundred men only three were left alive; two of them'* Argives, Alcinor and Chromius j and one Laced  monian, Othryadcs: These*! weie all the survivors when night came on. The Argives, as victors, ran in\"haste to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>; but Othryades, for the Laced  monians, having stripped the dead f bodies of the Argives, and carried off their arms lo the place where his own fide\"had encamped^ continued upon the field of battle. Next morning both parties\"came to learn the eyent; and then, truly, each party also claimed the victory j\"one averring, that a majority survived on their fide; the other maintaining, that\"even those had fled, whilst their own combatant had kept his ground and spoiled f* the dead. In short, from wrangling they came again to blows and a general engage-\"ment; in which, after great slaughter on bojh fides, the Laced  monians obtained f the victory.\" Whilst","image":false}
