{"text":" B. VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 197 When the land-army had quitted <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550913\" >Teos<\/span>, Tiflaphernes in person came thither with a body, and, after com- pletely demolishing those parts of the wall before <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550913\" >Teos<\/span> which were yet left standing, marched away. Not long after his departure, Diomedon, arriving there with ten fail of Athenians, in order to gain a re- ception, made a truce with the Teians. From thence he coasted along to Eras, and assaulted the place; but, not being able to take it, he sailed away. Coinciding with this in point of time, an insurrection was made at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span> by the people against the nobility. The Athenians, who with three ships were then lying at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span>, assisted the former. On this occasion the S&m'ian people massacred about two hundred persons, all of the nobility. Four hundred others they condemned to exile; and, having divided amongst themselves their lands and houses, and obtained from the Athenians a decree of being governed by their own constitutions, as men whose sidelity was no longer to be suspected, they assumed the whole civil administration, leaving no share of it in the hands ofthe landed gentry, and absolutely prohibiting to the people all alliance for the future with them, so as neither to give their daughters to them nor ever to marry theirs.-. After these transactions, during the same summer, the Chians, proceeding with unabating ardour, left no- thing undone to compass the revolt of the cities. Even without Peloponnesian aid they made them visits with their own single force; and, desirous at the same time to involve as large a number as possible in their own dangers, they undertake a voyage with thirteen fail of ships to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550763\" >Lesbos<\/span>. This squared exactly with the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  monian plan 1 which was to make the second ac- tempt upon that island, and from thence to proceed to Hellespont. The land-force, at the same time, of such Peloponnesians as were at hand, and their adjacent allies, attended their motions by the route of Clazomen  and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550506\" >Cyme<\/span>: These were commanded by Eualas, a Spartan;","image":false}
