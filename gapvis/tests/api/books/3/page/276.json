The whole number of shipping belonging to the'alliance, now assembled together there, amount- ed to thirty-nine. But Calligitus, truly, and Timagoras refused, in the name of Pharnabazus, to have any participation in the expedition to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>; nor would part with the money they had brought with them, which was* five and twenty talents, to disburse this equipment. They in- tended to get another fitted out, which should sail away under their own orders. As for Agis, when now he perceived that the Lace- d  monians were determined to go first to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, he no longer suffered his own projects to clash with those of the State; but the confederates now assembling at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span> proceeded to draw up a plan of operations.

But the first step should be the transportation of a moiety of their shipping across the isthmus, which were immediately to stand out to sea, that the attention of the Athenians might be less engaged upon such as were already in their course than on those which were to follow; for now they determi- ned to cross the sea in an open insulting manner, as they contemned the present impotence of the Athenians, because they had no considerable force any where at sea. When these resolutions were formally completed, they immediately transported one and twenty ships.* 4845\/. 151. Sterling. Expeditious","image":false}
