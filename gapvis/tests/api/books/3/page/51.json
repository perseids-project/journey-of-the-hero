{"text":" B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 63 spective commands. The orders, when any such are re- quisite, are in this method dispersed and circulated with the greatest expedition: For, in the Laced  monian armies, almost the whole soldiery, few only excepted, have a command assigned in regular subordination; and the care of executing orders is incumbent upon numbers. In their present array, the left wing consisted os the Skirit , who, of all the Laced  monians, ever claim this post as their peculiar right; next them were posted the Brasidean soldiers who had served in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501638\" >Thrace<\/span>, accom- panied by those who had lately been honoured with the freedom of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span>; then, along the line, were regularly posted all the troops which were composed of pure <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  monians; next to them stood the Hereans of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"668198\" >Arca<\/span>- dia, and beyond them the M  nalians.
