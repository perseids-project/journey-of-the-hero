{"text":" 284 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VHL Instantly, therefore, Agis their king, though in the depth of winter,sallying forth with a body of troops from Decelea, marched round the confederacy, levying sums of money for the service of the marine. Turning his route to the Melian gulf, he took a large booty from the CE- t  ans, against whom their enmity had been of long dura- tion, which he converted into money. He also compel- led those Ach  answho were seated in the Pthiotis, and other States in this quarter dependent on Theslaly, spite of all the complaints and murmurs of the Thessalians, to give him some hostages for their good behaviour, and to furnish him with money. He disposed of these hostages into safe custody at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span>, and spared no pains to get them over into the alliance. The Laced  monians, farther, circulated an order among the States, for the building of one hundred fail of ships. They taxed themselves and the B  otians to furnish, respectively, twenty-five  , the Phocians and Locrians fifteen; the Corinthians fifteen; the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"668198\" >Arca<\/span>- dians, and Pellenians, and Sicyonians, ten; the Me- gareans, and Trcezenians, and Epidaurians, and Her- mionians, ten. They went to work with all other needful preparations, that they might prosecute the war briskly upon the first approach of spring. The Athenians, on the other hand, were not remiss in preparing for their own defence; since, in pursuance of the plan they had formed, they were busy during all the winter in building of ships, having collected proper quantities of timber; and in fortifying <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"580107\" >Sunium<\/span>, that the navigation of their victuallers round that cape might be preserved from molestation. They also evacuated the fortress in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span> which they had raised in the voyage to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>; and in all respects, where they jud- ged themselves involved in any less needful expence, they contracted their disbursements with the utmost fru- gality. But their principal care was keeping a close eye upon their dependents, that they might not revolt. Amidst","image":false}
