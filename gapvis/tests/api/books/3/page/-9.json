But, when they could no longer maintain it, and at the same time the ships, sent round on pur- pose, had entered the harbour, Pasnelidas, fearing left the ships might take the town now left defenceless, and, when the rampart was carried by the enemy, he himself might be intercepted, abandons it immediately, and re- tired with all speed into the town: But the Athenians were already disembarked and masters of the place.
