{"text":" 3o8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII. But now, the Lesbians notifying again their readi- ness to revolt, Astyochus, in a conference with P  da- ritus and the Chians,\"maintains the necessity of go-\"ing thither with a squadron to support the revolt of\"Lesbos since, in consequence ot it, they must ei-\"ther enlarge the number of their confederates, or,\"even though miscarrying in the design, must hurt\"the Athenians-\" But they were deaf to this remon- strance; and P  daritus positively declared that he should not be attended by the ships of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>. Upon this, taking with him five fail of Corinthians, a sixth ship belonging to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570468\" >Megara<\/span>, and one more of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570292\" >Hermione<\/span>, and all the Laconjan which he himself brought thither, he stood away from thence to his station at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, uttering grievous threats against the Chians, that,\"how low soever they might be reduced, they should*' never receive any succour from him.\" Accordingly, touching fiist at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"648612\" >Corycus<\/span> of Erythr , he moored there for the night. The Athenians, who, from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span>, with a considerable strength, were now bound against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, were lying at the fame instant of time on the other side of the cape, but so stationed that neither party knew of the nearness of the other. At this junc- ture, a letter being delivered from P  daritus, that;t a\"party of Erythr  ans, who had been prisoners at Sa-\"mos and released from thence, are coming to Ery-\"thr  to betray that place,\" Astyochus puts out a- gain immediately for Erythr  ; and thus narrowly, on this occasion, d\\d he escape falling into the hands of the Athenians. P  daritus, farther, had made the pas- sage upon this affair; and both having joined in ma- king all necessary enquiries about those who were accu- sed of this piece of treachery, when they found the whole to have been a plot of the prisoners at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span> merely to recover their liberty, they pronounced them innocent, and so departed; the latter to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>; but the other, in pursuance of his first designation, made the best of his way to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>.","image":false}
