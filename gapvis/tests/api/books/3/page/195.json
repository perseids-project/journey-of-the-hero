THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 207   twenty talents of silver; impowered, farther, to as- sure them, that\"a large reinforcement will soon come\"up, as the State had seriously interested itself in their\"welsare.\" Demosthenes stayed behind to forward the equipment, and was intended to set out on the first approach of spring. He was busied in assembling to- gether their contingents from the dependent States, and in levying amongst them both money, and shipping, and soldiers. The Athenians farther send out twenty fail, to cruize on the coasts os <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, and to take care that no one passed over from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> into Si- cily. For the Corinthians, upon the arrival of the em- bassadors, and the advice they brought, that\"the face\"of affairs was much altered for the better,\" (priding themselves in the reflexion that their former equipment had arrived in time to contribute to this turn,) became now more alert than ever, and got transports in readi- ness to carry over a body of their own heavy-armed into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, whilst the Laced  monians were intent on doing the fame from other parts of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>. The <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinthians, sarther, manned out five and twenty fail; de- signing to hazard an engagement with the guard-ships stationed at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540960\" >Naupactus<\/span>, or to disable the Athenians who lay there from giving their transports the least molesta- tion, by keeping their own triremes ready ranged in or- der of battle in the very face of that squadron. The Laced  monians also were preparing for an inva- sion of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579888\" >Attica<\/span>, in pursuance of a former resolution, and in compliance farther with the pressing instances of both Syraculans and Corinthians. They had no sooner heard ot the reinforcement intended to be sent by the Athe- nians to Sicily, than, by making a diversion, they de- signed to stop its execution. Alcibiades also continued warmly importuning them to execute his plan of forti- fying Decelea, and to proceed briskly with the war.* 3875\/. Stirling, But","image":false}
