{"text":" B*.V. THE!PELOPONNESIAN WAR. ag bute of a*talent to Olympian Jove. This was regular- ly paid till the Athenian war; but, that war being then made a pretence of its discontinuance, the Eleans would have exacted it by force. The others had recourse to the Laced  monians. The dispute was referred to the Laced  monian arbitration i but the Eleans, taking up a suspicion that they should not have justice, would not abide the reference, but began to ravage the territory of the Lapreat . The Laced  monians, notwithstand- ing this, proceeded to a sentence:   that\" theLeprea- t  were masters of their own conduct, and that the\"Eleans were guilty of injustice;\" and, as the latter would not abide by their arbitration, they threw a gar- rison of heavy-armed into Lepreum; but the Eleans, regarding this step as the reception of a city by the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  monians which had revolted from them, and alled- ging the treaty in which it was stipulated,   that,\"of\"whatever places the parties were possessed upon the*' commencement of the Attic war, the same they\"should continue to hold at its expiration,\" as if they had met with injustice, they revolt to the Argives; and the Eleans entered into that league offensive and defen- iive as hath been already related. The Corinthians soon followed their example, and, with the Calcideans, also of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981552\" >Thrace<\/span>, became the allies of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>. But the B  otians and Megareans, though they had threatened the same thing, thought proper to drop it. They had been ill used by the Laced  mo^ nians, but judged however that the democracy of the Argives would be less compatible with their interests, whose form of government was oligarchical, than the polity of the Laced  monians. About the same time of this summer, the Athenians, becoming masters of the Scioneans after a long block- ade, put all who were able to bear arms to the sword, and made their wives and children staves, and gave the land to be cultured by the Plat  ans.* 193I. 15s. sterling.
