They concluded that, through the prevalence of the Laced - monian arguments, the B  otians had been persuaded to level Panactum and accede to the treaty made with A- thens, and that the Athenians were privy to all these steps; and so, of consequence, they themselves were now utterly excluded from an alliance with the Athe- nians, and their former hopes entirely blasted, that, in case disputes should arise, and their treaty with the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  monians not be renewed, they might, at worst, depend on gaining the Athenian alliance.
