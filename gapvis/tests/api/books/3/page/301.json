{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 313 But, about the fame juncture of time, the Chians and P  daritus, not bearing to acquiesce under the di- latory answers of Astyochus, pressed him, by repeated messages,\" to come over with the whole of his force, and relieve them from the present blockade; and by** no means to look indolently about him, whilst the*'.most important of the confederate States in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span> was\"shut up by sea, and by land exposed to rapines.\" For, the domestics of the Chians,   - being many in number, nay, the largest that any one community ex- cept the Laced  monians kept, and accustomed, be- cause of their multitude, to be punished with extraor- dinary severity for their misdemeanors,   - no fooner judged that the Athenian forces, by throwing up works, had gained a sure footing in the island, than large num- bers of them at once deserted to the enemy, and were afterwards the persons who, as persectly well acquainted with the country, committed the heaviest depredations.
