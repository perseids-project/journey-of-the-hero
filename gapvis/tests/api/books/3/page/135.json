{"text":",'B.Vl. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 147 attempt was executed by Harmodius and Aristogiton, from the impulse of a sudden consternation. But, after this, the tyranny became more grievous upon the Athe- nians. Hippias, who was now more than ever alarmed,.put many os the citizens to death; and cast his thoughts about towards foreign powers, to secure himself an asylum abroad in case of a total reverse at home. To  antidas therefore; the son of Hippoclus, tyrant of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501570\" >Lampsacus<\/span>,   to a Lampsacene though he himself was an Athenian,   he married his daughter Archedice, knowing that family to have a powersul interest with king Darius. And the monument of that lady is now at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501570\" >Lampsacus<\/span>, and hath this inscription: From Hippias sprung, with regal pow'r array'd,-'Within this earth Archedice is lay'd$ By father, husband, brothers, sons, ally'd To haughty thrones, yet never stain'd with pride. For the space of three years after this, Hippias con- tinued in possession of the tyranny at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>; but, being deposed in the fourth by the Laced  monians, and the exiled Aicm  otnid , he retired by agreement to Si- g  um: from thence, to  antidas at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501570\" >Lampsacus<\/span>; and, from thence, to king Darius: and, with a command un- der him, he marched twenty years aster to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"580021\" >Marathon<\/span>; and, though much advanced in years, ierved in that war with the Medes. The People of Athens, reflecting on these past trans- actions, and recollecting all the dilmal narratives about them which tradition had handed down, treated with great severity, and deep suspicions, all such as were in- formed against, in relation to the mysteries: and they con- strued the whole procedure as the dawning of a plot to Plutarch hath preserved a smart reply of Antipho the orator, who will appear in this history, to the elder Dionyfius, tyrant of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>. The latter had put the ques- tion, which was the finest kind of brass?\".That, replied Antipho, of which the** fbtucs of HaraK'dms and Arifiofiton were made.\"'L 2 erect","image":false}
