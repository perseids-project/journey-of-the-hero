But Demosthenes, when he had assembled the whole of the armament with which he was to pass over to the relief of those in Sicily, weighing from  gina, and standing over to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, he completes his junction with Charicles and the squadron of thirty sail of Athe- nians under his command; and, as a body of heavy- armed had been taken on-board the latter from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, they steered together for the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span>.
