{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 209 which Thucydides hath compiled the history, came also to an. end. YEAR XIX.J THE following spring no sooner approached, than, at an earlier date than on any former occasion, the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  monians and allies invaded <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579888\" >Attica<\/span>; and Agis, the son of Archidamus, king of the Laced  monians, had the command of the army. At first they ravaged the country, particularly the plains; and this being done, having allotted out the work in portions to the several States, they set out about fortifying Decelea. Now, Decelea is distant at most but*one hundred and twenty stadia from the city of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, and lies at the fame dis- tance, or very little more, from B  otia: but in the plain, and on the finest spot of ground, from whence effectually to annoy them, was their fortress raised; and might be seen from the very walls of Athens. In this manner the Peloponnesians and allies erected a fortress within <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579888\" >Attica<\/span> itself; whilst, in the same por- tion of time, their friends in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> embarked a body of heavy-armed on-board their transports, and sent them off for Sicily. For this service the Laced - monians picked out from the very best of the Helots and of those citizens of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570685\" >Sparta<\/span> who were newly enfran- chised, from both together, six hundred heavy-armed; and appointed Heccritus, a Spartan, to command them. And the B  otians sent three hundred heavy-armed, commanded by Xeno and Nicon of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"541138\" >Thebes<\/span>, and He- gesander of Thespi . These were first embarked at X  narus in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span>, and thence put out to sea. Soon after these, the Corinthians sent away five hun- dred heavy-armed; some from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span> itlelf, others hired from the Arcadians; and appointed Alexarchus,J Before Chiist 413.* About twelve milei.
