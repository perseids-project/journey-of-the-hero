And one horse- transport attended, which carried thirty horsemen. So great an equipment sailed out at first to begin the war. And, in the train of this equipment, went thirty storefhips laden with corn, and carrying on-board the bakers, and masons, and carpenters, and all things re- quisite in the works of fortification; and also a hundred sail of small vessels, which necessity demanded to attend the (hips that carried the stores. A large number also of small craft and trading vessels sailed voluntarily in company with the fleet, for the sake of traffic. All which now, in one collected body, stood away from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530834\" >Corcyra<\/span> across the Ionian gulf.

Their answer was, that\" they should*' side with neither party, but, whatever measures were** judged expedient by the other Italians, they should\"conform to those.\" The Athenians counsels were now solely bent on the affairs of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, in what manner they might most successfully make their approaches.
