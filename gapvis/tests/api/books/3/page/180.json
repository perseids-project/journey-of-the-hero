{"text":" I'ga THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VL truth, that\" <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span> was completely invested on all** sides.\" Gylippus upon this gave up all hopes of sa- ving Sicily; but, having the preservation of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span> still at heart, he and Pythen, the Corinthian, with the small squadron at hand, consisting only of two Laconic and two Corinthian vessels, crossed over the Ionian gulf with all possible dispatch to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span>. The Corinthians, besides their own ten now fitting out, were to man two belonging to the Leucadians, and three more belong- ing to the Ambraciots, and follow them as soon as pos- sible. The first step of Gylippus, now arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span>, was to go in quality of embassador to Thuria, claiming privilege for it, as his father had been a denison of that State; but, finding himself unable to gain their concur- rence, he weighed from thence and stood along the coast of Italy. But in the Terinean gulf he met with a hard gale of wind, which in this gulf, when in a nor- therly point, blows generally with great and lasting vi- olence, and now drove him from his course, and blew him out into the open sea, where he stood again the rebuff of another violent storm, but at length reached <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span>. He there laid his vessels on-ground which had been damaged in the foul weather, and resitted them for service. When Nicias found that he was in his passage, he be- trayed an open contempt of so trifling a squadron, as the Thurians had already done before him. It appear- ed to him, that so petty a squadron could only be fitted out for piratical cruizes, and therefore he sent out no detachments to hinder his approach. About the fame time of this summer, the Laced  mo- nians, with their own domestic forces augmented by the junction of their allies, made an irruption into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, and ravaged great part of that territory. The Athenians put out to lea with thirty fail to succour the Argives, which procedure was, beyond all denial, the clearest Violation of the treaties between them and the Laced - monians.","image":false}
