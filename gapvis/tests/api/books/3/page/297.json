{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 309 In the mean time, the armament of the Athenians, having sailed round from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"648612\" >Corycus<\/span> to Arginum, falls in with three long vessels of the Chians, and no sooner had descried than they, gave them chace. And now a violent storm ariseth, and the vessels of the Chians with great difficulty escape into harbour: But, of the Athe- nian squadron, three, which had molt briskly followed the chace, are disabled and drive ashore at the city of the Chians: The crews of them were partly made pri- soners, and partly put to the sword. The rest of the fleet got into a safe harbour, which is known by the name of Phcenicus, under the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550744\" >Mimas<\/span>. From hence they afterwards took their course to Ltsbos, and got all in readiness to raise fortifications. From <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, the same winter, Hippocrates the Laced  monian, putting out to sea, with ten sail of Thurians commanded by Doricus, the son of Diagoras, and two collegues, with one ship of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span> and one of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>, arriveth at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>. This place was now in revolt from Tissaphernes. Those at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span> were no sooner advised of the arrival of this squadron, than thay sent them orders, with one moiety of their ships to keep guard upon <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>, and with the other to post them- selves at the Triopium, in order to take under their convoy the trading-vessels which were in their course from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"766\" >Egypt<\/span>. The Triopium is a point in the territory of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>, jutting out into the sea, and a temple of Apollo. But the Athenians, informed of their designs, and standing away from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, take six of the ships which were stationed at the Triopium: The crews, in- deed, quit their ships, and reach the shore. This be- ing done, the victors sailed directly to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>; and, making an assault upon that city which was quite un- fortified, had very nearly taken it, On the next day they renewed the assault. Yet, as the inhabitants had taken care to make it more secure by favour of the night, and the men escaped from the vessels taken at Triopium had thrown themselves into the place, theyX 3 did","image":false}
