By excursions, also, through all the country, he made prize of all he found, except- ing seamen for such he dismissed unhurr. From <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599728\" >Cos<\/span> advancing by night ro <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599575\" >Cnidus<\/span>, he is diC- suaded by the Cnidians from landing his men; but, on the contrary, without loss of time to get out to sea, and make head against twenty sail of Athenians, which Charminus, one of the commanders from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span>, had under his orders, and with them was watching the ap- proach of the twenty-seven sail coming up from Pelo- ponnesus, which Astyochus was now going to join.

Astyochus, therefore, without loss of time, stood a- way for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550506\" >Cyme<\/span>, with a view to surprise the ships of the e- nemy at sea before they could get any advice of his ap- proach. A heavy rain and thick cloudy weather occa- sioned the dispersion of his vessels in the dark, and sadly disordered him. When morning broke, the fleet being widely separa- ted and the left wing driven already within the view of the Athenians, the remainder yet driving in confu- sion about the island, Charminus and the Athenians launch out against them with all possible expedition, though with fewer than twenty sail, imagining this to be the squadron from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"638796\" >Caunus<\/span> whose approach they were to observe; and, proceeding instantly to action, they funk three and dilabled others.
