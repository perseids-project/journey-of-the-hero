THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 331 Athenian squadron out at sea in a course from Chalce; yet, neither making any motion to bear down upon the other, one fleet pursued their course to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, the o* ther put into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>. They were now convinced, that, without fighting at sea, they could not possibly relieve <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>. Here this winter ended: And the twentieth year of this war expired, the history of which Thucydide  hath compiled. YEAR XXI.J IN the ensuing summer, upon the first commence- ment of the spring, Dercylidas, a Spartan, at the head of an army not considerable for numbers, was senr. over- land to Hellespont to effectuate the revolt of Abydus: They are a colony of the Milesians. The Chians also, whilst Astyochus was perplexed about thejmethod of re- lieving them, were necessitated, by the intolerable closeness of the blockade, to hazard an engagement ac sea. It happened, whilst Astyochus was yet in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"590030\" >Rhodes<\/span>, that Leon, a Spartan, who came over with Anrislenes, though merely as a passenger, had arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span> from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, to act as governor after the death of P  daritus, with twelve sail of (hipping draughted from the squa- dron stationed at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>: Of thelc, five were Thurian, four Syxacusan, one belonged to An  a, another was Milesian, and one was Leon's own.
