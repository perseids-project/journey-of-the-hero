To Aspendus, however, whatever was his view, Tissa- phernes repairs, and joins the Ph  nicians; nay, far- ther, at his own desire, the Peloponnesians sent Philip- pus, a noble Laced  monian, with two triremes, to take charge of this fleet. Alcibiades had no sooner received intelligence that Tissaphernes was at Aspendus, than, taking with him thirteen sail, he hastened thither after him, promising to those at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> an assured and important piece of ser- vice: For,\" he would either bring the Ph  nician\"fleet to the Athenians, or at least prevent their junc-\"tion with the Peloponnesians.\" It is probable that, from a long acquaintance, he was privy to the whole intention of Tissaphernes never to bring up this fleet; and his project was now, to render Tissaphernes still more odious to the Peloponnesians for the regard he shewed to himself and the Athenians, that so he might at last be necessitated to strike in with the latter.
