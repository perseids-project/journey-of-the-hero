{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 221 road of Phia of the Eleans, on-board of whicsra num- ber of heavy-armed Corinthians were to pass over into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, finks that vessel. But the mariners, having saved themselves by flight, found afterwards another vessel, and proceeded in the voyage. From hence Demosthenes came up to Zacynthus and,Cephallene; where he took their heavy-armed on- board, and sent for those of the Messenians from Nau- pactus. He also crossed over to the opposite continent of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530767\" >Acarnania<\/span>, to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530793\" >Alyzia<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530798\" >Anactorium<\/span>, both be- longing to the Athenians. Thus employed as he was in augmenting his force, Eurymedon, returning from Sicily, whither he had been sent in the winter to carry a supply of money for the army, meets him; and, a- mongst other intelligence, relates, that\" he had heard,*' since he was upon his return, that Plemmyrium had** been taken by the Syracusans.\" Conon also, who commanded at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540960\" >Naupactus<\/span>, came to them, with advice, that\" the five and twenty fail of Corinthians which\"lay over-against their squadron had not quitted that\"station, and even threatened them with an engage-\"ment.\" He exhorted, therefore, these commanders to detach some vessels thither, since their squadron at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540960\" >Naupactus<\/span>, consisting only of eighteen ships, was not a match for the enemy, whose squadron amounted to twenty-five. Upon this, Demosthenes and Euryme- don detach ten of the prime sailors, amongst those un- der their own command, to follow Conon for the re- inforcement of the squadron at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540960\" >Naupactus<\/span>. The two former continued to assemble forces for the grand expedition. Eurymedon, for this purpose, sailed to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530834\" >Corcyra<\/span>, commanded them to man out fifteen ships, and selected himself the heavy-armed for the ser- vice; for, as he was returned from carrying the stores, he joined himself with Demosthenes in the command, in pursuance of the prior nomination. Demosthenes was collecting a body of slingers and darters from the towns of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530767\" >Acarnania<\/span>. The","image":false}
