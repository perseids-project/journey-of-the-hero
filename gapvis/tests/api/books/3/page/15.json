{"text":" B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 27 No sooner had theM antineans revolted, than the rest of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> began to mutter that\"they ought also\"to take the same step,\" imagining that revolt to have been founded upon some stronger reasons than yet ap- peared; exasperated also against the Laced  monians for sundry reasons, and, above all, for this article in the peace with Athens,   that,\"in case the two States of\"Laced  mon and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> think proper to make any\"additions or alterations, the same to be lawful.\" For this was the clause which gave the greatest alarm to Pe- loponnesus, and inspired a jealousy that the Laced  mo- nians might strike up a bargain with the Athenians to inflave the other States; since, in justice, no alteration ought to be made without the concurrence of the whole confederacy.
