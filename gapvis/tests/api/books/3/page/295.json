He there summoned such of the inhabitants as were at- tached to the Athenians to remove with their effects up to Daphhu's, and leave him in possession of the place; Tamus, farther, the sub-governor of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span>, joined with him in the summons. But, when the inhabitants re- jected this offer, he made an assault upon the city, which had no fortifications; yet, miscarrying in the at- tempt, he put off again to sea in a hard gale of wind, and reached, With those ships that kept up with him, to Phocea and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550506\" >Cyme<\/span>; but the rest of the squadron was by stress of weather forced over to the isles which lie near to Clazomen ,      Marathusa, and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550807\" >Pele<\/span>, and Dri- mussa and, whatever effects belonging to the Clazo- menians had by way of security been deposited there, during eight days continuance, which the stormy wea- ther obliged them to stay, they partly plundered and partly destroyed; and, having secured their booty on- board, got away to Phocea and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550506\" >Cyme<\/span>, and joined As- tyochus.
