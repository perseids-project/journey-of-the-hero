{"text":" THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B-VII. From this time the Syracusans rushed upon them from thence, and awed all their motions. The convoys could no more get in without fighting their way. Besides that, in all other respects, it struck a great consternation, and even a dejection of mind, amongst the troops. The next step taken by the Syracusans was to send out to sea a squadron of twelve ships, under the com- mand of Agatharcus, a Syracusan. One of these ships was to proceed to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, and land an embassy there, which had instructions,** to notify a present\"hopeful posture of affairs, and to press the prosecu,tM tion of the war in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span> with all possible vigour.\" The other eleven stood over to the Italian coast, having received intelligence, that a number of small vessels, laden with stores for the Athenians, were coming up..
