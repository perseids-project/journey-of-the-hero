{"text":" 364 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VIII. were aground; and others posted themselves upon the walls and at the mouth of rhe harbour. But the Peloponnesian fleet, having sailed by and doubled the cape of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"580107\" >Sunium<\/span>, comes to anchor between <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"580119\" >Thoricus<\/span> and Prasi , and proceeds afterwards to Oro- pus. Hereupon the Athenians, in all imaginable hurry, manning out their ships with what hands could be got on this sudden emergency, as in a city distracted with sedition, and yet eager to stave off the greatest danger that had ever threatened it, (for, as <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579888\" >Attica<\/span> was occu- pied by the enemy, Eub  a was now their all,) cause Thymocharis, a commander, to stand away with their fleet to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579925\" >Eretria<\/span>.

For, through the management of the Eretrians, nothing could be got by way of sale, except in such houses as lay in the most remote quarters of the city i with an intent that the enemy might attack the Athenians before they were all embarked, and oblige them in a hurrying and disorderly manner to begin the fight.
