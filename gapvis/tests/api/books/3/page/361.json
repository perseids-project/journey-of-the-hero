{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 373 deed in their present situation: For hitherto, afraid of the naval strength of the Peloponnesians, because of the rebusfs they had lately received from it, and the cala- mitous event of the Sicilian expedition, from this mo- ment they stopped all fruitless self-accusations or ground- less exaggerations of the enemy's ability by sea. Some ships of the enemy in fact they take; for instance, eight Chian, five Corinthian, two Ambraciot, two B  otian; but, of Leucadian, and Laced  monian, and Syracu- san, and Pellenean, a single one of each: But then they sufsered the loss of fifteen ships of their own. After erecting a trophy upon the cape of Cynos-sema, and picking up the shatters of the fight, and giving up, under truce, their dead to the enemy, they dispatched a trireme to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, to notify the victory. On the ar- rival of this vessel, those at home, after hearing the news of this unhoped-for success, greatly resumed their spirits, which had been dejected by the recent misfor- tunes at Eub  a and the fad efsects of their sedition, and hoped the State might again resume its power if they cheerfully exerted their efforts in its behalf. On the fourth day after the battle, the Athenians, having diligently resitted their fleet at Sestus, sailed a- gainst <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"511218\" >Cyzicus<\/span>, which had revolted: And, descrying eight ships from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\" >Byzantium<\/span> riding at anchor under Harpagium and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"511375\" >Priapus<\/span>, they crouded fail towards them j and, having in battle upon the shore deseated their crews, made prizes of them all. Repairing thence against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"511218\" >Cyzicus<\/span>, which was quite unfortified, they re- duced it once more, and exacted large contributions from it. But, during this interval, the Peloponnesians made a trip from Abydus to Eleus, and brought off as many of their own ships which had been taken as were able to, fail j the residue the Eleusians burnt. They also dis- patched Hippocrates and Epicles to Eubcea, to setch up their fleet from thence.B b 3 About","image":false}
