In the mean time, Strombichides, with the eight fail of ships, arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> j and, taking with him tune Samian vessel, stood onwards to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550913\" >Teos<\/span>, and required of them\" to have no participation in the present commo-** lions.\" From <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, also, Chakideus was now co- filing over to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550913\" >Teos<\/span>, with a fleet of three and twenty fail; and the land-force of the Clazomenians, and also of the Erythr  ans, attending his motions, was march- ing thither by land: But Strombichides, having timely notice of their approach, pot out again before thefrr ar* rival. Standing out aloos into open sea, he had a view of this numerous fleet in their course from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>; upon Which he fled amain to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>. But the enemy fol- lowed in pursuit. The Teians, who at first refused admittance to the land-forces, when now the Athenians plainly fled, thought proper to open their gates. Here the busk of them were inactive for a time, attending the return of Chalcideus from the pursuit. But, when time wore on without his appearing, they demolished of their'own accord the wall'Which the Athenians had built on the   fide of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550913\" >Teos<\/span> facing the continent. In this they were also assisted by a small party of Barbarians, who in'this'interval had joined them, and were commanded by Tages, the deputy of TissaphernCs. But Chalcideus and Alcibiades, when they had chased Strombichides into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, having furnished the mari- ners of the Peloponnesian vessels with proper arms, leave them as a garrison in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>. Having manned their vessels afresh at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, with an additioivof twenty others, they stood away for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, as meditating its revolt. This was owing to Alcibiades; who, having:an interest in persons of the first rank among the Mile- sians, made it a point to effectuate their accession before the fleet should come up from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, and to'fe* cure the whole honour to the Chians and himself, and Chalcideus","image":false}
