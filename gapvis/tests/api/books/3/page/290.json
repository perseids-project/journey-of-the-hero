But now, after erecting a trop&y, as the town was seated on an isthmus, the Athenians were preparing to cut it off by a work of circi*mva>latioa; concluding that,\" if they once could get possession of*' <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, they should easily complete she reduction\"of the other Slates\" It was now about the Chut of evening, and advice is brought them that\" five and fifty fail of ships from*' <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span> are only not at hand.\" For, from Sicily, where Hermocrates the Syracusao strenu- ously advised to go on with what yet remained in re- gard to the total demolition of the Athenians, twenty fail of Syracusans and two of Selingntians came over.
