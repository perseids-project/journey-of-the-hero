{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 115*' were indebted to a parallel coincidence of events*' for the vast enlargement of their strength and empire,** when the Mede, who gave out that he aimed the blow*' at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, was, contrary to all human expectation,\"disconcerted by a series of errors that were purely his\"own. And some such fortunate coincidence, in our\"own behalf, we have at present all imaginable rea-\"son to expect.\"Let us therefore with active resolution put our do-\"mestic affairs into a posture of defence, and dispatch\"our embassadors to the SicuJi, to keep firm in our*' friendship such as are already our friends, and to** endeavour to procure the friendship and concurrence*' of the rest.
