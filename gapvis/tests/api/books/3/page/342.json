{"text":" 3S4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIH.** in order that those who served in the armies of the** State might be better subsisted, he praised them alto-** gether. He then recommended to them a steady re-* ( sistance, and by no means in any shape to give way** to the enemy: For, could the State once be secured** from its public fops, a reconciliation amongst its\"members might easily be hoped for; but, should** either party be once destroyed, either this at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>,\"or theirs at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, none would soon be left to be** reconciled at all.\" There were present at this audience embassadors from the Argives, who brought assurances of aid to the peo- ple of Athens at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>. Alcibiadcs commended them for their zeal j and then, exhorting them to hold them- selves in readiness to come upon a summons sent, he civilly dismissed them. These Argives came to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> in company with the Paralians, who had been lately turned over by the four-hundred into a vessel of war, to cruize round Eubcea, and to carry to Laced  mon the embassadors, L  spodias, Aristophon, and Melesius, sent thither from the four-kundred.

They had no business now at Athens, and so came from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span> to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, convoying the Argive embassadors in the trireme which they had seized.

In regard to the Peloponnesians, he decla- red that he substituted his own lieutenant, Tamas^ to pay them their subsistence, whilst he himself should be absent.","image":false}
