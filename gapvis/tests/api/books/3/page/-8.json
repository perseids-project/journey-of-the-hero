{"text":" 4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V. board Ph  ax, the son of Erasistratus, with'whom two other persons were joined in commission, to execute an embassy there. For the Leontines, after the departure of the Athenians from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, in consequence of the joint-accommodation, had inrolled many strangers as denizens of their city, and the populace had a plan in z- gitation for a distribution of the lands. The noble, alarmed at this, gain the concurrence of the Syracusans and eject the commons. They were dispersed, and wan- dered up and down as fo many vagabonds; whilst the noble, striking up an agreement with the Syracusans, a- bandoned and left in desolation their own city, settling at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span> as free citizens of that place. And yet, foon after, some of this number, dissatisfied even here, forsook Syracuse again, and seize upon Phoce , a quar- ter of the old city of the Leontines, and upon Bricin- ni , which is a fortress in the Leontine. Hither the greater part of the ejected commons resorted to them j and, adhering firmly together, from these strong holds they annoyed the country by their hostilities.\"When the Athenians had intelligence of this, they fend out Ph  ax, to persuade, by all proper methods, their old allies in that country, and to gain, if possible, the concurrence of the other Sicilians, to take up arms, for the preservation of the people of Leontium, against the incroaching power of the Syracufans. Ph  ax, up- on his arrival, recommendeth the scheme successfully to the Camarineans and Agrigentines. But his negotiations meeting with fome obstacles at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462214\" >Gela<\/span>, he desisted from addressing himself to the rest, since he was assured he could not possibly succeed. Retiring therefore through, the district of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462493\" >Siculi<\/span> to Catane, and calling on his road at Bricinni , and having encouraged the malcon- tents there totpersevere, he departed. Not but that, in this Sicilian voyage, both passing and repaffing, and also upon the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span>, he had urged to several ci- ties\" how expedient for them was the Athenian\"friendship.\"","image":false}
