They had been driven to this necessity by se- ditious factions at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570479\" >Messene<\/span>, one of which had invited them thither since the joint-accommodation among the Si- cilians; and now they were forced to shift again, though <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570479\" >Messene<\/span> had for a time been entirely in their power. Ph  ax therefore, meeting with these in their removal, gave them no annoyance; for the Locrians had been at a conference with him, to concert the measures of an a- greement with the Athenians. These, however, were the only party of all the consederates, who, when the Sicilians had amicably ended their disputes, refused to treat with the Athenians, and were brought to such submission since merely by a war, in which they were embroiled against the Itonians and Meleans, who bor- dered upon them, and were colonies of their own.

And, during this interval, he himself lay quiet at Eton. But Brasidas, informed of these proceedings, placed himself in an opposite post at Cerdilium. This place be- longeth to the Argilians, and is seated on an eminence on the other side of the river, and at no great distance from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>. From hence he had a perfect view of all Clton's motions; so that now it was impossible for the latter to make any approach with his army, from thence to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>, without being discovered.
