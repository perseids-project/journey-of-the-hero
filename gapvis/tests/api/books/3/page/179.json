{"text":" B.VI.; THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i9c After this, the Athenians erected a trophy, and, in pursuance of a truce, delivered up their flam to the Sy- racusans, and received in exchange the body of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"403235\" >Lama<\/span>- chus, and of those who fell with him. The junction of their whole armament, both of their land and naval force, being now completed, they be- gan again, from Epipol  and the crag, to invert the Syracusans with a double wall, which they were to continue quite down to the sea. The necessary provi- sions to supply their army were brought in from all the coasts of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span>.

The distresses, also, which environed them ac present, struck into them mutual suspicions of one ano- ther: Nay, they even divested of their charge the ge- nerals who were in authority when these distresses came upon them, as if all was owing to their misconduct or treachery, and chose in their stead Heraclides, and Eu- cles, and Tellias. In the mean time, Gylippus, the Laced  monian, and the ships from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span>, were come up to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530975\" >Leucas<\/span>, designing with the utmost expedition to.pass over from thence to Sicily.
