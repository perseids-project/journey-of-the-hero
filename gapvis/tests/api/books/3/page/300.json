{"text":" 3i* THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII. And to this situation were brought the Athenian affairs at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>. Their squadron also at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> made several visits to the squadron of the enemy at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>; but, as the lat- ter refused to come out to engage them, they returned again to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, wirhout committing any hostilities. From <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, in the same winter, twenty- seven sail of ships, equipped by the Laced  monians for Pharnabazus, at the instances of his agents, Calli- gitus the Megarean and Timagoras the Cyzicene, put out to sea, and made over to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span>, about the solstice. Antisthenes the Spartan was onboard as admiral. With him the Laced  monians sent also eleven Spartans, to be a council to Aflyochus; in the number of whom was Lichas, the son of Arcesilaus. To these an order was given, that,\" when arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, they should.** in concert act in all respects as might be best for the*' service; and this squadron, or one equal in strength,*' or larger or smaller, at their own discretion, should\"proceed to Hellespont for the service of Pharnabazus, and be sent away under the command of Clearchus\"the son of Ramphias, who accompanied them in the'* voyage; and, in cafe it was judged expedient by the'* council of eleven, to dismiss Astyochus from the chief,f command, and substitute Antisthenes.\" On account of the letters of P  daritus, they began to suspect the former. This squadron, therefore, standing out to sea from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550713\" >Malea<\/span>, arrived first at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570475\" >Melos<\/span>; and, falling in with ten sail of Athenians, they take and burn three of them, which their crews had abandoned. But, appre- hensive that those Athenian ships which had escaped might advertise the fleet at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> of their approach, as was actually the case, they stretched away for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"589748\" >Crete<\/span>; and, for better security, keeping a good look-out, and taking more time, they made land first at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"638796\" >Caunus<\/span> of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599527\" >Asia<\/span>. From thence, as being now beyond the reach of danger, they dilpatch a messenger to the fleet at Mile- Jus., to attend and bring them up,","image":false}
