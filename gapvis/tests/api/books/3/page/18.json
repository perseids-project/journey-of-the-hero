{"text":" 30 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V, They also again brought back the Delians to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599587\" >Delos<\/span>, induced to it by the many defeats they had suffered in battle, and the express oracle of the god at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540736\" >Delphi<\/span>. The Phocians also and Locrians began about this time to make war upon one another. And now the Corinthians and Argives, united ifl league, go together to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570707\" >Tegea<\/span>, to persuade its revolt from, the Laced  monians. They saw it was a large district; and, in case they compassed its accession, they imagined the whole of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> would be ac their beck. But, when the Tegeat  declared, that\" they\"would in no shape oppoie the Laced  monians,\" the Corinthians^; who till now had acted with great alacrity, slackened in their zeal for contention, and began to fear that no more of the States would come in.

To A- thens, indeed, they bore them company, but could not obtain the ten-days truces: For the Athenians answer- ed,  \" The Corinthians have a peace already, if they\"are confederates of the Laced  monians.\" And, up- on the whole, the B  otians absolutely refused to re- nounce their own truces, though the Corinthians insisted upon ir, and urged, with some warm expostulations, that it had been so covenanted between them. So there was only a mere cessation of arms between the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinthians, ","image":false}
