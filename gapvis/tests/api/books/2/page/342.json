Having thus secured in his own hands the whole command, he or- dered the legions to proceed by rapid marches to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383628\" >Cremona<\/span>, while a large de- tachment went forward to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"393438\" >Hostilia<\/span> (&). He himself turned off towards <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"393480\" >Ravenna<\/span>, under a pretence of conferring with the officers of the fleet, but, in fact, with a design to make the best of his way to the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383798\" >city<\/span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383798\" >of<\/span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383798\" >Pavia<\/span>, judging that place the fittest for a treasonable convention.
