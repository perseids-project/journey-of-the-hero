{"text":" SECOND BOOKOF THE HISTORY. 369 Section II. (a) <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"373757\" >Berenice<\/span> was sister to Agrippa II. and wife of Herod, king of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540703\" >Chalcis<\/span>, in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"29492\" >Syria<\/span>. For more of her, and her connexion with <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span>, see Appendix to Hist. v. s. 21. (b) When <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span> no longer sails along the coast, but puts off to sea, Tacitus calls it a bolder voyage, audentio- ribus spatiis; an expression, which, in the present state of navigation, may provoke the smile of a mariner. The compass was not invented, and men did not like to lose sight of the shore. (c) At the town of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"707586\" >Paphos<\/span>, which stood on the western sideof the isle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"707498\" >Cyprus<\/span>, a temple was dedicated to Venus, thence called the Paphian Venus. The account of the rites and ceremonies, which Tacitus gives us, has been condemned by some critics as an idle digression: but when it is considered that the history of superstition was not uninteresting to the' Romans, this passage will not be thought improper. The great historian has been charged with irreligion; but the attention shown on this occasion, and many others, to the various modes of worship, may serve to vindicate his character. Section III. (a) Aerias has been mentioned in another place, as the founder of the Paphian temple: Annals, iii. s. 63. Tacitus adds, that the name of Aerias was applied by many to the goddess herself; and accordingly, Pausa- nias, lib. i. cap. 14, calls her Ovgavlav. (b) Cinyras is said by Apollodorus to have been one of the kings of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"29492\" >Assyria<\/span>. (c) Thamiras introduced the science of augury, which was founded altogether in deceit and fraud. Accor- dingly, we find that care was taken to keep it in the VOL. V. 2B","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA367&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U3Npes9CeI9P4rEysrFC4vfEynDDQ&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
