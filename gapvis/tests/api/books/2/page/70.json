{"text":" 70 THU HISTORY book\" We must live or perish together. There is no alternative. The humanity of Galba is well known to us all. Perhaps, even while I speak, he has pronounced\" our doom. To yield to the advice of\" his friends, will be an easy task to him,\" who without a request, of his own free\" will, in cold blood, could give to the\" edge of the sword so many thousand in-\" nocent soldiers, all destroyed in one\" inhuman massacre. My heart recoils\" with horror, when I reflect on the dis-\" astrous day when he made his public\" entry into the city. After receiving the\" submission of the soldiers* with un-\" heard-of treachery he ordered the whole\" body to be decimated (a); and, in the\" view of the people, exhibited a scene of\" blood and horror. These are the exploits\" of Galba, and this his only victory. With\" these inauspicious omens he entered the\" city of Rome;   and what has been since\" the glory of his reign? Obultronius Sa-\" binus and Cornelius Marcellus have\" been murdered in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1027\" >Spain<\/span>; Betuus Chilo\" in Gaul; Fonteius Capito in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"20468\" >Germany<\/span>;\" and Clodius Macer in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"324852\" >Africa<\/span>.
