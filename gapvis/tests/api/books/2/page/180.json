{"text":" 182 THE HISTORY book ted to his love of queen <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"373757\" >Berenice<\/span> (a). It is true, that princess had engaged his af- fections; but the business of his heart never interfered with the duties of his station. Youth being the season of pleasure, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span> gave a loose to those desires, which he afterwards so well knew how to regulate. In his own reign he was remarkable for that self-control, which he never prac- tised under his father. He set sail from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span>, and after steering along the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991372\" >Achaia<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991380\" >Asia<\/span>, which lay to the left, he directed his course towards <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"590030\" >Rhodes<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991392\" >Cyprus<\/span>. From those islands he went, by a more bold navigation (6), across the Open sea to the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"531109\" >Syria<\/span>. At <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991392\" >Cyprus<\/span> cu- riosity led him to visit the temple of the Paphian Venus, famous for the worship paid by the inhabitants, and the conflux of strangers who resorted thither from all parts. If we take this opportunity to trace the origin of that singular worship (c), and to describe the situation of the temple, and the form of the Goddess, differing en- tirely from what is seen in any other place, the digression will, perhaps, be neither tedious, nor unacceptable to the reader.","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA180&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U0aa58pVEkc_08EFCOcV_rRAzaMRg&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
