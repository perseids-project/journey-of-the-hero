{"text":" NOTESON THE SECOND BOOKOF THE HISTORY. Section I. (a) THACITUS says that fortune was then laying the foundation of a new imperial house, which proved to be beneficial and disastrous to the people, and also to the very family that was raised to that pre-emi- nence. This is perfectly clear, when we consider, that <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\" >Rome<\/span> was happy under Vespasian and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span>, but groaned under Domhian, till the tyrant was destroyed, and the Flavian line was extinguished.{b) <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span>, at this time, was in his twenty-eighth year. By the favour of Narcissus, to whom Vespasian paid his court, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span> was educated in the palace with Britannicus, the son of Claudius. The prince, then destined by his father to succeed to the empire, was cut off by the vil- lany of Nero; and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span>, whose elevation was not then foreseen, lived to be the delight of the Roman people. (c) Suetonius tells us that Narcissus, the favourite freedman, consulted a fortune-teller about the destiny of Britannicus: the answer was unfavourable fo the young prince, but assured <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197553\" >Titus<\/span> that he was born to the impe- rial dignity. Suetonius, in Tito, s. 2.","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA366&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U3t8qRhDMV5sivzP8NonZNIOkGjGw&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
