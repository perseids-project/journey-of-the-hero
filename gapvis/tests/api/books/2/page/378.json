{"text":" 380 NOTESON THE speech upon this occasion shows that he could think with dignity. See Suetonius, life of Otho, s. lO. Section XLVIII. (a) Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula, were of the Julian line; Claudius, and Nero (by adoption) were of the Claudian; Galba was of the house of Servius; Otho, of the Salvian family. Section XLIX. (a) This was Verginius Rufus, who conquered Vindex in Gaul, and had the moderation to decline the imperial dignity when offered to him by the legions. See Appen- dix to Annals, xvi. s. 12. (A) Nero, in his last distress, fearing that his head would be exhibited as a public spectacle, gave directions for his funeral. Otho did the same: though tainted with Nero's vices, he closed the scene with dignity. (c) Plutarch tells us, that he himself visited Otho's tomb at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383602\" >Brixellum<\/span>. Those perishable materials have long since mouldered away; but the epitaph, written by Martial, will never die. The poet admits that Otho led a dissolute life; but adds, that, in his end, he was no way inferior to Cato. Dum dubitaret adhuc belli civilis Enyo, Forsitan et posset vlncere mollis Otho; Damnavit multo staturum sanguine Martefn, Et fodit certa pectora nuda manu. Sit Cato dum vivit, san  vel Caesare major; Dum moritur, numquid major Othone fuit? Lib. vi. epig. 31. SectionL. (a) See Annals, xiii. s. 46 j Hist. i. s. IS; and Sueto- nius and Plutarch. 2","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA378&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U34UcZwa6K-u9CtHTl2VvYE8_ddGA&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
