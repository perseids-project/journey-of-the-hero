{"text":" 336 THE HISTORY book Hus resolved to solemnize the obsequies of Nero. He erected altars to that emperor in the Field of Mars. The sight was highly pleasing to the vile and profligate, but gave disgust to all who had any principle, or a spark of remaining virtue. Victims were slain, fires were kindled, and the torch was carried by the Augustan priests; ah order dedicated by Tiberius to the Julian family, in imitation of that conse- crated by Romulus to Tatius (b) the Sabine king. From the victory at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383584\" >Bedriacum<\/span> four months had not elapsed; and yet, in that short time, Asiaticus, the manumitted slave of the emperor, had already accu- mulated riches nothing short of the Poly- cleti, the Patrobii, and others of the ser- vile race, whose names have been given up to the execration of mankind. The court of Vitellius was not the scene of honest emulation. No man endeavoured to rise by his virtue or his talents. The road to preferment was open to vice and luxury.^ He who entertained the prince in the gayest manner, and with S&mptuous banquets glutted that craving appetite* was sure to be in favour.
