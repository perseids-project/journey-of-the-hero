{"text":"OF TACITUS. 109 and the Roman people. Those specious book words, which a few days before resounded with so much energy, Avere dropt at once; and the men, it now was plain, were never in their hearts the soldiers of a republic. The Agrippinian people, the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"109390\" >Treveri<\/span>, and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"177564\" >Lingones<\/span> were determined not to be be- hind-hand in demonstrations of zeal. They offered a supply of arms and horses, of men and money, in proportion to their re- spective abilities. The strong and valiant were willing to serve in person; the rich opened their treasure; and the skilful gave their advice. The leading chiefs, as well in the colonies as in the camp, who had already enriched themselves by the spoils of war, wished for another victory that might bring with it an accumulation of wealth. The zeal with which they enr tered into the league, was. what might be expected; but the alacrity of the common men Avas beheld with wonder. Poor and destitute, they made a tender of their tra- velling subsistence, their belts, their ac- coutrements, and the silver ornaments of their armour; all excited by one general impulse, a sudden fit of blind enthusiasm.","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA109&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U2KKmkrWZowECEbrf81ms871ghvgg&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
