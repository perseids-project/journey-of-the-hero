{"text":" 362 NOTESON THE   Section LXV. (a) For the animosity that subsisted between the people of Lugdununi (Lyons) and the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"128537\" >city<\/span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"128537\" >of<\/span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"128537\" >Vienne<\/span>, see the Appendix to Annals, xvi; and for Vienne, see the Geographical Table at the end of the Eighth Volume. (I) The people of Lyons waged war against Vindex, and on that account Galba made them feel his resent- ment. (c) The cities of Lyons and Vienne were separated by the river Rhodanus; now the Rhone. (d) The people of Vienne favoured the revolt of Vindex. See the Appendix to Annals, xvi. Section LXVI. (a) Olive branches and sacred vestments were usually displayed in cases of distress, when the conquered sued for mercy. So we read in Livy: Ramos olece ac vela- menta supplicum porrigenfes, orare, ut reciperent sese, rcceptosque tutarentur. Livy, lib. xxiv. s. 30. Section LXVII. (a) The territory of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"177534\" >Helvetii<\/span> was a part of Celtic Gaul, more extensive than what is now called Switzer- land. The people are celebrated by Julius Cassar for their military virtue, and constant warfare with the Germans. <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"177534\" >Helvetii<\/span> reliquos <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"609384\" >Gallos<\/span> virtute prcecedunt, quod fere quotidianis prceliis cum Germanis contendant, cum avt suis finibi\/s eos prohilent, aid ipsi in eorum Jinilus lellwn gerunt. Caesar Bell. Gall. lib. i. s. l. (b) Brotier says, this place was called in antient in- scriptions, Respublica aquensis, on account of the salu- brity of the waters. He supposes it to be what is now called Baden, in the territory of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"20620\" >Switzerland<\/span>.","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2X5KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA360&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U3rrx5UmyWUKQMECzOrC4fni8_oYw&ci=0%2C0%2C1000%2C2000&edge=0"}
